# Hi everyone! 

This chapter (chapter 5) of the Design of Everyday Things focused on human error, including explaining and categorizing it. Here is a part that stood out to me.
## Categorizing Mistakes
The discussion of slips vs mistakes was something that super interested me, especially from a game design perspective. The entire book (at least until this point) has been about explaining away embarassing mistakes people perform, and explain why the fault lies in the design of the thing they were interacting with. I find it really interesting to categorize these mistakes and explain how something like that could be avoided. 
Also, thinking in terms of game design, there are plenty of situations where player mistakes are often intended. I always find it interesting when games play with this idea, like how Resetti jokingly plays with the player tampering with their save file in Animal Crossing, or how a certain fight in Omori recontextualizes its battles. Games are really a place where you can explore and toy with the idea of mistakes and really make some of the edge cases that people encounter into something unique and memorable, rather than a punishment. After all, mistakes happen.
(Sorry for rambling!)
