# Hi everyone! 

This week's reading was the second/last half of Chapter 4, and had to do with restraints, affordances and signifiers. Here's some parts I found interesting. 
## Constraints 
Leading the section was the discussion around forcing user constraints for desired behavior, such as only being able to turn on a car while having its key. I think this comes down the to lead horse to water arguement, where you want whatever you make to lead users into whatever the intended use is, even if they have never seen it before. Sort of like how the most attention on a light switch is the part that moves, if that makes any sensse.
## Sound as a signifier
I honestly think that this section could have been a chapter in itself. There is a very interesting intersection between audio and interactivity that I feel isn't really ever explored in a very thoughtful way. Popping bubble wrap or cracking open a soda can are very satisfying and memorable things to do, simply due to the noise they make. Even without technological beeps, the soft snap of a lightswitch turning on or off is an indication that it has changed, and a little bit of satisfaction in itself.  


### Thank you all! Wishing you all the best!
